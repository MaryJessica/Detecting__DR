          <p class="card text-justify" class="card-text">Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that weakens the blood vessels in your retina. There are two types of diabetic retinopathy: Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR): 
            In this early disease stage, people have blood vessels which leak in the retina. This manifests with either fluid, hemorrhage, or lipid seen in the retina. Eventually these blood vessels close causing ischemia or 
            poor blood flow. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR): When the disease progresses, abnormal blood vessels grow in response to the ischemia. These abnormal vessels can leak blood into the gel-like substance (vitreous) 
            that fills your eye and cause tractional changes to the surface of the retina detaching it and resulting in severe vision loss in late stages.  Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising
             on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services.</p> <P class="card text-justify" class="card-text"> The retina is a tissue in the back of the eye that sends signal to your brain akin to the film in a camera. 
             The retina converts light rays into electrical impulses that communicate with your brain. These impulses are what enable you to see (vision). How does diabetic retinopathy affect my body? Without treatment, diabetic retinopathy may lead 
             to vision loss, low vision or blindness. Who might get diabetic retinopathy? Anyone who has diabetes can get diabetic retinopathy, including people who have: Gestational diabetes. Type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes. If you have 
             diabetes, risk factors for diabetic retinopathy can include: Pregnancy. Hypertension. Uncontrolled blood sugar. Hyperlipidemia. The duration for which you have had diabetic retinopathy.

          <h5 class="card text-center" class="card-title">SYMPTOMS AND CAUSES</h5>
          <p class="card text-justify" class="card-text"> Diabetes can cause multiple eye diseases including cataracts, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy which is defined as damage to the retinal vessels of the eye. These damage vessels can lead to poor blood flow 
            (ischemia), inflammation, and ultimately legal blindness if not treated. What are the symptoms of diabetic retinopathy? In the early stages, most people experience no signs of diabetic retinopathy. You 
            may not experience vision changes until the condition is severe. For some people, symptoms come and go.Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy include: Blurred or distorted vision. New color blindness or seeing 
            colors as faded. Poor night vision (night blindness). Small dark spots (eye floaters) or streaks in your vision. Trouble reading or seeing faraway objects.</p><P class="card text-justify" class="card-text"><B> DIAGNOSIS AND TESTS</B></P><P class="card text-justify" class="card-text">  An eye doctor (ophthalmologist) can diagnose diabetic retinopathy during a simple exam. Visual acuity: Acuity refers to how clearly you can see. Intraocular pressure to make sure there are no signs of glaucoma. 
            Eye muscle function: Muscle function refers to how well you can move your eyes. Peripheral vision: Peripheral vision is seeing from the sides of your eyes. Pupil response: This assessment looks at how your pupils react to light.
             Then, your eye doctor will put drops into your eyes. The drops dilate (widen) your pupils (centers of the eyes). During this exam, the doctor looks for: Abnormal blood vessels. Bleeding in the center of your eye. Growth of new blood vessels. Retina swelling. </p>
